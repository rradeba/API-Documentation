Implementing Swagger Documentation for Factory Management System API
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to integrate Swagger documentation into the Factory Management System API to provide clear and comprehensive documentation for developers. This will enhance the usability of the API by providing detailed information about endpoints, request parameters, request bodies, and response formats.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with implementing Swagger documentation for the Factory Management System API. The API manages various aspects of factory operations, including managing employees, tracking production, monitoring inventory, handling customer orders, and managing customers. The goal is to create Swagger documentation that accurately describes each endpoint and provides examples of request and response formats.

Task 1: Create Documentation for Each Model for Create and List Operations

Generate documentation for each model in the Factory Management System API, focusing on the Create and List operations.
Document the required request parameters, request body (if applicable), response format, and examples for creating and listing data for each model (Employee, Product, Order, Customer, and Production).
Ensure that the documentation provides clear instructions for making requests and understanding the responses for creating and listing data.
Validate the documentation to ensure that it accurately reflects the API behavior and covers all necessary details for developers to interact with the API effectively.
Task 2: Generate Error Responses for Each Endpoint Related to the Customer Model

Implement error responses for each endpoint related to the Customer model in the Swagger documentation.
Include a description of the error and an example of the response body for each error scenario.
Ensure that the error responses cover common error cases, such as invalid input, missing data, or server errors.
Validate the error responses to ensure that they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the API.
Task 3: Generate Successful Responses for Each Endpoint

Implement successful responses for each endpoint in the Swagger documentation.
Include a description of the response and an example of the response body for each successful scenario.
Ensure that the successful responses provide clear information about the data returned by the API and any additional details, such as status codes or success messages.
Validate the successful responses to ensure that they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the API.
Expected Outcomes:

Upon completing this assignment, you should achieve the following outcomes:

Comprehensive Swagger documentation for the Factory Management System API, covering all endpoints and operations.
Clear documentation for creating and listing data for each model in the API, including examples and instructions for developers.
Error responses documented for each endpoint related to the Customer model, providing guidance on handling errors gracefully.
Successful responses documented for each endpoint, ensuring developers understand the expected data format and behavior of the API.
